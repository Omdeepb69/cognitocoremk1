# **CognitoCoreMk1** ✨

## DESCRIPTION 🚀
Meet CognitoCoreMk1: your Python-powered sidekick, kinda like JARVIS but runs on code, not glowy chest things. Uses Gemini for the big brain stuff, fetches info, runs basic tasks, and even handles comms. Basically, it's your digital co-pilot, iykyk.

## FEATURES 🤖
*   **Smart Convos:** Gets your vibe with Gemini 2.5, asks questions if you're being sus. No cap. 🧠
*   **Web & System Wizardry:** Surfs the web for the latest tea ☕ and bosses your OS around (nicely, mostly).
*   **Comms Control:** Can draft emails like a pro via SMTP. WhatsApp integration? It's on the roadmap, maybe. 📧
*   **Voice Activated:** Talk to it, it talks back. Hands-free flexing with speech rec and TTS. 🗣️
*   **Personality Included:** Engineered with a witty, helpful, maybe *slightly* sarcastic JARVIS-esque personality. It's got rizz. 😎

## LEARNING BENEFITS 💡
Level up your AI game! You'll learn to build agentic systems, wrangle LLMs like Gemini, juggle APIs (web, system, comms), make it talk and listen, and basically feel like Tony Stark in his workshop. Seriously cool stuff.
